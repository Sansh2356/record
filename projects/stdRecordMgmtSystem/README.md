# Student Record Management System
- In this project I have created a management system that explains all the four CRUD operations i.e (C) create (R) read (U) update (D) delete.
- What I have used are in `package.json`
- let me name them: `Node js`, `Express Js`, handlebars`, `mongoose`, `nodemon`
# How you can approach this ??
- step 1: install node js (npm is install with it)
- step 2: run the `npm init` command inside the terminal, this will generate `package.json` file
- step 3: install the required things by running the commands `npm i express`, `npm i hbs`, `npm i mongoose`
- step 4: create three folders named `src`, `views`, `public`
- step 5: inside src folder create `app.js` file to create express app and handle the requests
- step 6: create webpages in `.html` and style it in `.css` file
- step 7: move the `.css` files in the `public` folder and `.html` file in `views` folder after renaming it to `.hbs` file
