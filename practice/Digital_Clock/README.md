# Digital_Clock
- In this I have shown how to create digital clock using html css and javascript.
# Steps
- First: create 3 files with names as per your choice with extension .html, .css, .js you can also do in single file i.e index.html
- second: create a basic layout using html and css, in this step you have to create eigth(8) 6 times for hrs:min:sec
- third: logic part i.e inside index.js file we will make change to all the eight based on current local time.
# Changing (8) logic
- change the background and border color of each 6 sides of (8) which are upperhalf (top, left, right), mid, lowerhalf (left, right, bottom)
- use of `<id>.style.background="<color>"` and `<id>.style.borderColor="<color>"`
# How to get current time using Js?
- create a object named data as `let date = new Date();`
- use of method: 
- 1.date.getHours()
- 2.date.getMinutes()
- 3.date.getSeconds()
# check out my code how I implemented this logic using `dicts` and `arrays` in index.js file.
# Have a look on UI:
